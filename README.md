In this repository, we developed the code for the final project for OOP Class.
Here are the instructions to run it on Replit or your local machine.

## Replit execution

In the [Replit](https://replit.com/join/ebuqvcchbl-codewithlui) Shell, use the following commands to execute the code.

```bash
cd src
g++ main.cpp ./Classes/Movies.cpp ./Classes/Video.cpp ./Classes/Series.cpp ./Classes/Video2.cpp ./Classes/Episodes.cpp
./test
```

When executing the code, i recommend that the Shell window is on full screen.
## Installing in your own machine

To install it in your own machine, you have to install [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads) in your own machine, then you check your directory and execute:
```bash
git clone (you obtain the link in the green button that says "Code")
```
To run it, it's the same steps as Replit.
